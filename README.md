# 2D_Mario_Like_Platformer
A platformer where you score points by hitting gems and lose HP when getting struck by enemy projectiles.
The point is to finish the level and collect as many gems as possible.

All rights reserved to the Game Development course from ACS study program of Universitatea Politehnica Bucuresti, who provided me many of the game assets.
Also, I'd like to thank Unity Technologies for using their awesome 2d-extras package and Aron Granberg for using his really cool A* Pathfinder.
I am only responsible for the gameplay development, level design and the enemy animations.
